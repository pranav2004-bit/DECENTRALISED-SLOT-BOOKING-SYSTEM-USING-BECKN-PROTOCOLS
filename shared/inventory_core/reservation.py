"""Reservation Window / TTL-based `HELD` state (livetracker2.md §1.3), Redis-backed — reuses
the real Redis dependency and TTL/state pattern already proven live via Phase 4.2's
`RedisCircuitBreaker` (`shared/resilient_http/circuit_breaker.py`), the one real, live-proven
Redis precedent for this (not Phase 2's in-memory-only rate limiter — see §1.3's own correction
note in the tracker).

Kept separate from models.py because it orchestrates two different real dependencies (Postgres
+ Redis) together, matching this codebase's existing service-layer pattern (e.g. BPP's
`core/onboarding_service.py`) rather than folding cross-cutting orchestration into a fat model
method.

Right-sized for this project's current `[MVP]` stage: expiry is detected opportunistically (a
caller checks "is this hold still live?" the next time it touches that booking/slot — e.g.
before attempting a new hold on the same slot), not via a background daemon subscribed to Redis
keyspace-notification events. That would require enabling keyspace notifications and running a
perpetual listener process — real operational complexity this project doesn't have infrastructure
for yet (no task queue/worker process exists in any of the four apps). The TTL key itself is the
actual source of truth for "is this hold still active"; the DB-side reconciliation
(`release_expired_hold`) just needs to run before the result is trusted, which every real caller
of this module already does on the hot path.
